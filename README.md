# Responsive-Portfolio
Homework
"D" is for "div," "D" is for discipline ... I have tried to be much more disciplined in my code.  This is seen in the folder/directory "Most basic portfolio."
"Most basic portfolio" represents hours (days?) of time I spent in my attempt to put together all of my (2 weeks?) worth of knowledge of HTML and CSS. It's not very good, but it does show improvement, I hope.
I found the solution to the first homework assignment yesterday. Seeing the solution was immensely helpful.  My initial attempts have a lot of redundancy and overspecification.  I see how something like adding the same container div to the header, main content, and footer, and then styling ONE container is a much, much, much more efficient solution.  It also makes debugging so immensely more straightforward.
Unfortunately, I didn't know if I should adapt the solution with my "unique" code, or try to improve the original index file.  I tried a bit of both.  Not a good idea.  No.  
So, that's where we are right now. I just hope that you (someone?) see that I'm fumbling/trying, and take that into consideration.

Thank you.
